#Hello World

This sample contains a haxe version of the Hello World sample from [dartlang.org/samples](https://www.dartlang.org/samples/) to be compiled to [dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) using [hx2dart][1].

To compile:

1. run haxe build.hxml

For comparison the following output is compiled or included in the bin folder:

* **[dart.dart](bin/dart.dart)** : original dart source
* **[hxdart.dart](bin/hxdart.dart)** : dart output compiled by haxe


Each version has a corresponding html file. The Chromium browser included in the dart SDK must be used to view the dart versions. 

*see also [hxjs2dart][2]*
